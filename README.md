👋 Hi, I'm a tech enthusiast with a strong foundation in Python and a passion for backend development and automation.

💡 I enjoy writing clean, efficient code and building tools that solve real-world problems.
🐧 Comfortable working in Linux environments and experienced with Git for version control in collaborative projects.
☁️ I have practical experience with AWS services for deploying and managing cloud infrastructure.
🐳 I’ve studied Docker and understand how to use it for containerizing applications and creating consistent development environments.

🧠 Currently sharpening my problem-solving skills through LeetCode as part of my interview preparation and continuous learning.

🚀 I'm actively working toward a role as a Python Developer, where I can apply my skills, learn from experienced teams, and grow in a collaborative environment.
